This website was built by me using Github pages and Jekyll. Given my limited experience with web development this was a quick and interesting project. Jekyll definitely made things a lot easier on my end once it was set up especially because I didn't have to deal with any of the css styling. Here is the link to the [github repo][website-repo]

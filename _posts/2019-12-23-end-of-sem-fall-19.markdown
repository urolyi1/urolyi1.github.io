I did not blog nearly as much as I wanted to, but deep down I sort of predicted this would happen in the previous post. The beginning of the semester is always filled with optimism and aspirations to do more. Without fail though things revert mostly back to the way they were. The resolution to replace procrastination with blogging and other productive activities is quickly forgotten in the heat of midterms. Blink, then its finals and the before you know it another semester has zoomed by.

I did change though, obviously, not to the lofty expectations imagined, but nevertheless I grew. So while, I didn't accomplish all my goals exactly, I wouldn't call it a failure (maybe this is just me rationalizing though). In this post, I want to revisit some of my objectives from the last post and see how I did. 

I had two main goals this semester, to work on more personal projects and also to finish a research environment for my finance club, SIF. The personal projects started of strong with this website, and also a neural network written using just numpy. But, again this initial surge quickly died down and I haven't really worked on a project since finishing the neural network. I will say I have been writing code and overall spending a lot of time on my research with a professor here. However, the main issue has just been a lack of motivation. An excuse I could give would be that I haven't had any project ideas, but this isn't really fair. If I had been more committed to this goal, I'm sure I would have found plenty of projects to do. As for SIF, that has been a great success. recruiting went extremely well and we have finished the core functionality for our internal database and backtesting tools.

1. "Go to the gym a minimum of 2 times a week, focusing mainly on rehabbing and strengthening my shoulder.": This was pretty much a complete and total success and this honestly was a surprise to me. Last year, I had a similar goal last year but quickly fell off once things got busy. There were two key points that made this successful, in my opinion. I didn't think of the gym as an optional activity, when I woke up it was never an internal debate whether I would go to the gym that day. Also, I found a time that worked really well for me. I went either, right after class or between scheduled classes, making it efficient and easy to go.

2. "Make some new friends especially in non-math and computer science classes": This one was definitely not as successful as #1. I definitely made new friends and got closer with a lot of people this semester, but the point of this goal was to expand my friend group to a more diverse group. Naturally, most of the people I met and hung out with this semester were of similar interests and focus. This isn't really that bad, but I am definitely going to keep working on this one and trying to meet more new people.

3. "Waste less time": I would categorize this a moderate success. I was definitely overall busier than I have ever been in college which forced me to be more productive. In addition, to this natural force, I enjoyed being productive more than I ever have. THere is still room for improvement, but I am cautiously optimistic about this trend.

4. "Give at least one math club lecture": Yeah....I didn't do this. I did give a SIF lecture though.

5. "Go to more seminars": Again, didn't do this one either.

Not surprisingly, there is a mix of successes and failures here and a lot in between. Going forward, it'll be just as important to make sure I don't revert back on the successes as it will be to work on improving the failures.

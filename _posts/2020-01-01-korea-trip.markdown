I've been going to Korea every year for a few years now. My grandparents, uncles, and cousins all live there, so my mom and I visit them in the Winter. Usually, Korea is a great way for me to relax after a stressful semester. I come here and eat **great** food and don't have any obligations. This is a double edged sword though because there's a fine line between relaxing and boring. Even just getting around in Korea is significantly harder than at home. Back home, I can drive, take the metro, or Uber/Lyft almost anywhere, but in Korea I can't drive, Lyft and Uber are banned, and even the subway is difficult due to my struggle reading Korean. The biggest issue though is that I don't know anyone my age here. All my cousins are way younger than me and I've never really had an opportunity to make friends my age here.

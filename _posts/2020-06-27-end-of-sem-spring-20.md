I know I've' kept my many avid readers waiting for a blog post. I apologize for the delay as I know how many people are dedicated readers and how I've let them all down...just kidding, but I'm back for another post reflecting on my spring 2020 semester albeit extremely delayed. Life changed drastically over the the course of the semester. One week, everything was normal then within the span of two weeks COVID-19 changed everything. After spring break, all my classes went fully online and we were not allowed to return to our dorms. I would soon find out that my summer internship would also become virtual. Obviously, I wasn't happy about any of this, but there wasn't much I could do during an unprecedented global pandemic.

I tried my best to roll with the punches and finished the semester without too much issue. Studying at home wasn't ideal, but it also wasn't a huge issue. The real issue was the isolation.

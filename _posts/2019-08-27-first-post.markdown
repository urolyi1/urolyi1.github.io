I want to use this first blog post to introduce myself along with some of my goals for this semester. In the past, I've occasionally felt the urge to start a blog and write about random things I find intriguing. Obviously, I never got around to it, but after making this website I thought it was a perfect time to start. Being 100% honest, I am probably not going to be blogging on a regular basis, but hopefully I have that urge to write more than just this once. The two main goals of this blog are to improve my relatively mediocre writing abilities and also provide me a place to vent/express anything I want to. So, with all that being said I will use this first post to record my goals for this Fall 2019 semester. Hopefully, when I look back at this post I will have accomplished everything (extremely unlikely).

This is the start of my sophomore year and this year I really want to focus on doing some more personal projects. This goal is off to a good start with this website/blog, but I really want to keep this up even through all the chaos of midterms and projects. I want to have a concrete goal, so I'm arbitrarily setting it to be to spend at least 2 hours a week working on projects unrelated to school. This seems like a reasonable amount of time I can set aside even during those crazy weeks. I actually just put this in my todoist as a recurring task so now I pretty much have to do it or I will die. The reason I really want to push this is because I feel like I am starting to get familiar with programming in general to make it much easier to implement small projects and scripts.

My second goal has to do with a club I am now co-leading. The club is called the Smith Investment Fund and this is pretty much the second year it is fully running. I see this as a great opportunity for me to get leadership experience. This will definitely be one of my main time commitments, but I'm extremely excited about this opportunity. The specific goal for this semester is to have a working research environment and database setup. This is probably the objective I am the least confident I will achieve, since it is so hard to foresee complications and accurately estimate the time needed to complete major projects.

Finally, here are some of the smaller things I want to keep up with this semester.
* Go to the gym a minimum of 2 times a week, focusing mainly on rehabbing and strengthening my shoulder.
* Make some new friends especially in non-math and computer science classes.
* Waste less time (will probably naturally happen with a busier schedule, but something I definitely could work on)
* Give at least one math club lecture
* Go to more seminars
This is pretty much a wish list and I would be beyond thrilled if I completed all of them, but being ambitious isn't necessarily a bad thing right? (or is it?)

Welcome to my website! I am a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, majoring in Math, Computer Science, and Economics. My interests lie in leveraging mathematical techniques, programming, and economic ideas to solve difficult real-world problems. I am and have been involved in numerous projects all related to and combining aspects of economics, math, and computer science. 

I am currently doing research with Dr. John Dickerson, using deep learning to create an matching mechanism for kidney exchanges. In the past, I have also done research with Dr. Michael C. Fu on option pricing and presented this research at the Winter Simulation Conference in 2018. On campus, I am the co-president of the Smith Investment Fund (SIF), heading the quant team with [Ryan Downing](https://ryansdowning.com). For more information about SIF checkout [smithinvestmentfund.com](https://smithinvestmentfund.com) and for a more details about my background, here is my [CV](./CV.pdf).

I am a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, majoring in Math, Computer Science, and Economics. I enjoy combining programming and mathematical techniques to solve and approach difficult real-world problems. I am currently doing research with Dr. John Dickerson that uses machine learning to create an matching mechanism for kidney exchanges. In the past, I have also done research with Dr. Michael C. Fu on option pricing. On campus, I am the co-president of the Smith Investment Fund (SIF), heading the quant team with [Ryan Downing](https://ryansdowning.com). For more information about SIF checkout [smithinvestmentfund.com](https://smithinvestmentfund.com). For a more details about my background, here is my [CV](./CV.pdf).
